      <h1>Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</h1>
      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an established technique for
    delivering better software faster. TDD is based on a simple idea: write
    tests for your code before you write the code itself. However, this
    "simple" idea takes skill and judgment to do well. Now there's a practical
    guide to TDD that takes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade
    of experience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how to
    let tests guide your development and “grow” software that is coherent,
    reliable, and maintainable.</p>
      <p>Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the processes they use, the design
    principles they strive to achieve, and some of the tools that help them
    get the job done. Through an extended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD
    works at multiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the
    object-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to discover
    and then describe relationships between objects. Along the way, the book
    systematically addresses challenges that development teams encounter with
    TDD—from integrating TDD into your processes to testing your most
    difficult features. </p>
