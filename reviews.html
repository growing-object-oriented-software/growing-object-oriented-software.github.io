      <p><cite><a href="http://blog.martinig.ch/books/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests/">Methods and Tools</a></cite>: I will consider it a must for anyone
      programming in Java, but I will also recommend it to people programming
      in other languages, as the thinking process could be applied in other
      contexts and with similar tools.</p>

      <p><cite><a href="http://giorgiosironi.blogspot.com/2010/04/growing-object-oriented-software-review.html">Giorgio Sironi</a></cite>: Growing object-oriented software, guided
      by tests is a masterpiece on Test-Driven Development, a valid guide for
      the beginner in this field and for the almost expert as well. ... The
      title describes exactly the purpose of the practices presented in the
      book: starting an ambitious project from scratch, and expand the product
      from an empty skeleton to a fully-featured application. ... The book is
      oriented to a Java audience, but if you exclude the last two chapters
      every practice and principle is just tied to real object-oriented
      programming and not to particular programming languages. For examples,
      PHP 5 has a complete object paradigm and the necessary tools (PHPUnit,
      Zend_Test) to practice the techniques described in the book.</p>

      <p><cite><a href="http://gojko.net/2009/11/20/dark-arts-of-tdd-explained/">Gojko Adzic</a></cite>: Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by
      Tests, by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce is a TDD book, but unlike any
      other on the market today. First of all, the book deals mostly with
      advanced unit testing topics, such as designing tests for readability
      and mocking, and addresses many common stumbling points that people
      experience with unit testing a few years after they started their
      journey, such as applying unit testing in multi-threaded and
      asynchronous environments. Second, it explains and demonstrates in
      practice the dynamics of designing software through TDD, which is still
      a dark art for many programmers. And third, it gives the reader insight
      into Freeman’s and Pryce’s brains...</p>

      <p><cite><a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2010/01/06/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests/">Miško Hevery</a></cite>: The book starts right at the
      beginning as to why we want to develop test first and covers advanced
      topics such as testing persistence, threads, and asynchronous code. I
      particularly like the style with which the book delivers the message.
      They start by building a simple application and add new requirements to
      it, morphing the codebase in the process. As they do so they introduce
      new classes and walk the reader through the thought process considering
      alternatives finally choosing a solution. This gives the reader a good
      understanding as to what to think about when looking at code. Of course
      all of these changes are driven by tests, and a lot of discussion is
      spent on explaining why a test was written in a particular way and how
      to refactor it as it grows with the applications, so that tests do not
      become a liability. ... If you are newbie, or an intermediate to
      developing with tests than this book is a must for your library!</p>

      <p><cite><a href="http://kaczanowscy.pl/tomek/2010-01/growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests-book-review">Tomek Kaczanowski</a></cite>: This book is so great that I could
      write tons about it, but I tried to keep it reasonably short. ... you
      can see not only what choices the authors (experienced programmers) make
      but you can also read why they took such and such decision. It is like
      sitting next to a great coder, looking at what he does, and listening to
      his explanation on why he does it. Invaluable. ... This book is a
      must-have. It is a pleasure to read, and gives you plenty to think
      about. Just go and buy it.</p>

      <p><cite><a href="http://blog.davidpeterson.co.uk/2010/03/growing-object-oriented-software-guided.html">David Peterson</a></cite>: Almost every programming book I've read
      has irritated me. ... Java books are the worst because Java's the
      language I use most and know best. I still read them because there are
      usually a few good ideas buried inside, but it irritates me that I have
      to wade through so much tosh. So far, Growing Object-Oriented Software,
      Guided by Tests is the only exception. There's no tosh. It's incredible.
      I've read the book two or three times and each time I felt myself
      becoming a better programmer. If you haven't read it yet, I can't
      recommend it enough.</p>
